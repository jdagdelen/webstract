##### Characterization method

###### Part of speech: NN,  NP

Any method for used to characterize a material, experiment or theory: e.g., photoluminescence, XRD, tight binding, DFT. It can also be a name for an equation / model.

Include keywords such as `microscopy`, `technique`, `method`, `analysis`, e.g. only if necessary.

Include spectroscopy, e.g., `Raman spectroscopy`, but not spectrum: `Raman` spectrum.

i. We studied the microstructure using (`scanning electron microscopy`, NP)

ii. We calculate the band structure using (`tight binding`, NP)

iii. glasses was also compared with theoretical data calculated by (`Appen and Bresker's equation`, NP)

Exclude non-specific references to a group of methods, e.g. Surface characterization, optical characterization.

i. Surface analysis was carried out with the aid of `SEM` and `AFM`

Highlight the technique OR the device, `scanning electron microscopy` OR `scanning electron microscope`.

`magnetic measurements` is a characterization method.

`magnetic characterization` is not a CMT. Label `magnetic` as a property since ti the characterization method is not specific.
If is is specific, label as cmt.

`Photoluminescence` properties should be labelled as CMT.

Same with `Dosimetric` characteristics

`I-V curves`, `C-V curves` are CMT
