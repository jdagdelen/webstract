###### **Goal**
Identify abstracts (papers) that include materials *potentially* found in the
materials project database. These are mostly, but not limited to inorganic
crystals. This stage serves as a filter for more advanced annotation tasks, e.g.
identifying materials or synthesis methods.

&nbsp;

###### **Guidelines**
- Inorganic chemistry, physics and materials science are mostly relevant, whereas
biology and organic chemistry are mostly not relevant.
- Examples of non-relevant abstract often include studies on cells, proteins,
viruses, organic polymers, etc.. and do not include any inorganic crystals or materials.
- Examples of relevant abstracts are studies of inorganic crystals, amorphous materials,
nanowires, nanoparticles, substrates, etc.
- If you think the abstract is on the borderline, annotate it as relevant.


###### **Instructions**
- If the abstract is not relevant, click `NOT RELEVANT`.
- If it is relevant, select the type (Experimental, Theoretical, Both or leave blank if not clear)
and press `CONFIRM`.
- If the presented abstract looks incomplete or strange, press `FLAG`.
- If you are not sure what to do with it, press `SKIP`.
