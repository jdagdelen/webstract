##### Synthesis Method

###### Part of speech: NN, JJ, VB, NP

Definition: Any technique for synthesising a material, e.g., pulsed laser deposition, solid state reaction. Does not include post-processing such as annealing.

Include keywords such as `deposition`, `technique`, `method`, `synthesis`, e.g. `solid state synthesis`, `sputter deposition`, only if recessary to make sense.

i. Films we deposited using (`pulsed laser deposition`, NP)

ii. We (`sputtered`, VB) GaN films

iii. GaN films were grown by (`sputtering`, NN)

iiii GaN films were deposited using the (`sputtering`, JJ) technique

Oxidized, e.g., `thermally oxidized` is ok.

Always collect the most informationL: e.g., `rapid thermal annealing` over rapid thermal `annealing`

Doping can be a SMT when written as: The films we modified via La `doping`
