##### Application / Device

###### Part of speech: JJ, NN, NP

Definition: Any high-level application such as photovoltaics, or any specific device such as field effect transistor.


i. PbTe has been expored for use in (`solar cells`, NP)

ii. Ferroelectrics may be useful in `non-volatile switching applications`

Note that properties like thermoelectric are not applications:

iii. PbTe has important (`thermoelectrics`, JJ) applications

Similary, in transparent conducting oxides, `transparent` and `conducting` are properties, `oxides` is a MAT.

Coating is an application in noun form, "this material has aopplications in `hard coatings`", but not the verb, "the `coating` of the material improved wear resistance", in that case coating is SMT.

Do not highlight the material in: `cathode` material.

Things like heterostructure, are better off as a descriptor rather than a device.
