##### Structure/phase label

###### Part of speech: JJ

Names for crystal structures, e.g., tetragonal, zinc blende, fcc, or any symmetry label Pbnm, Pnma (can google any if
unsure). Note that this is only for specific crystal structures, i.e., orhtorhomic is ok, perovskite is not. Amorphous
is not a crystal structure.

i. In the ground state BN is (`hexagonal`, JJ)

ii. The perovskite SrZrO3 has an (`orthorhombic`, JJ) crystal structure with (`Pbnm`, JJ) symmetry

If a meterial is mentioned only in terms of a phase, label it as a phase: "GdTiO3 had the common `GdFeO3`-type phase"
